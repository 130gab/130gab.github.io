			This is a simple page created by me(a nice guy named Gabriel Goh). Over here, you can find my projects and my opinions and possibly other stuff. Right now, I am writing this piece of text to take some space on my home page. I will continue to write useless words until I think of something to say. I can't write about myself because there is an about page for that. Oh wait. There isn't? Then I'll write about myself.

			I am Gabriel Goh. Male. Due to privacy/security issues, I shall not disclose my age.
